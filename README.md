# Evaluating the Effectiveness of Statistical Models in Analyzing Mortality in Canada: 

####                   A Practical Application of Negative Binomial Regression

> This repository contains a dataset and analysis focusing on mortality trends in Canada from 2000 to 2022. The dataset includes information on the total number of deaths, leading causes of death, age at the time of death, gender distribution, and partial places of residence.
